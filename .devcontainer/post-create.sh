# This script runs after the development container is created.
# It prepares the Python development environment using Poetry.

# Responsibilities:
#   - Display environment information
#   - Configure Poetry environment behavior
#   - Generate/update poetry.lock
#   - Upgrade core tooling (pip)
#   - Generate/update poetry.lock
#   - Install dependencies
#   - Synchronize the virtual environment
#
# The script fails immediately on any error.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Enable strict mode:
#   -E : Propagate ERR trap
#   -e : Exit on error
#   -u : Treat unset variables as errors
#   -o pipefail : Fail if any command in a pipeline fails
set -Eeuo pipefail

# Restrict word splitting to newline and tab for safer scripting

# log <message>

# Outputs a timestamped log entry.
# Used instead of plain echo to improve traceability in CI logs
# and container startup diagnostics.

# Toolchain Visibility
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Display Poetry metadata to confirm toolchain version.
# Useful for debugging environment inconsistencies between
# local development and containerized builds.
log "Poetry version:"

# Display detailed environment information.
# Provides visibility into:
#   - Python version
#   - Virtual environment path
#   - Active configuration
# This output is valuable when diagnosing dependency resolution issues.
log "System information:"

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Environment Configuration
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Configure Poetry to create the virtual environment inside the project.
# This ensures:
#   - Predictable environment location (.venv/)
#   - Easier debugging and inspection
#   - Better compatibility with editors and tooling
log "Configuring Poetry to use in-project virtual environments..."
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true

# Upgrade pip to the latest version.
# Ensures compatibility with modern packages and avoids known issues
# with outdated pip versions in base container images.
log "Upgrading pip..."
pip install --upgrade pip

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Dependency Resolution
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Generate or update poetry.lock.
# Ensures dependency resolution is deterministic and aligned
# with pyproject.toml before installation.
log "Writing Poetry lock file..."
poetry lock

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Environment Installation
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Install project dependencies into the virtual environment.
# Reads exact versions from poetry.lock to ensure reproducibility.
log "Installing dependencies..."
poetry install

# Synchronize the environment strictly with poetry.lock.
# Removes packages not defined in the lock file to prevent drift.
